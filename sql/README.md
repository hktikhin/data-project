# SQL Data Modeling Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates our skills in data modeling and SQL query writing. We created a 3NF model using the Open-Flight dataset and ingested the data into Postgres using Python/Pandas. We then used Postgres and SQL statements to transform the 3NF model into a dimensional model and compared their performance using the DVD Rental dataset from Postgres' sample dataset. 

## Skills Demonstrated

In this project, we demonstrated our ability to:

- Create a 3NF model and a dimensional model to represent datasets
- Write SQL queries to answer business questions and transform datasets
- Ingest data into Postgres using Python/Pandas or SQL

## Files
