# Data Science Project

## Overview

This repository is a collection of projects that showcase my skills in data science. Each project demonstrates my ability to collect and preprocess data, analyze and visualize data, build and evaluate machine learning models, and effectively communicate insights and findings. Through these projects, I have developed expertise in various areas, including but not limited to:

- Data collection and preprocessing: I have experience working with various types of data, including structured and unstructured data, and have demonstrated the ability to preprocess data using techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, normalization, and scaling.
- Data analysis and visualization: I have experience using Python libraries such as matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly to analyze and visualize data, and have demonstrated the ability to identify patterns and trends in data, and effectively communicate insights through visualizations and other methods.
- Machine learning: I have experience building and training different types of machine learning models, including but not limited to linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks. I have also demonstrated the ability to evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and to tune hyperparameters to improve model performance.
- Graph analytics: I have experience working with graph-based data structures and have demonstrated the ability to use graph theory and graph-based techniques to solve problems such as recommendation systems and portfolio selection.
- Deep learning: I have experience working with deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras and have demonstrated the ability to build and train neural networks for tasks such as image classification and natural language processing.
- Python programming: I have demonstrated the ability to use Python effectively for data science tasks, including but not limited to data manipulation, data visualization, machine learning, and deep learning.
